    "text": "The application 'Calculator of some special functions' was created as a result of the master's thesis of the same name, B.Sc. Eng. Sara Lazić, from the subject of Special Functions at the master academic studies in Software Engineering at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Belgrade, under the mentorship of prof. Dr. Bratislav Iričanin. The goal of this application is to allow users to quickly and efficiently evaluate the values ​​of some special functions that are most often encountered in various fields of science and engineering. The calculator provides support for calculating and graphically displaying the values ​​of the following functions: Bessel functions of the first, second and third kind, Laguerre polynomials, Legendre polynomials, Jacobi polynomials, as well as Chebyshev polynomials of the first and second kind."
